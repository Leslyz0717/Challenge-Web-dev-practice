    <h1>when Engineering Erases Nature: The Jonglei Canal Case Study</h1>
    <p>In South Sudan, the Sudd wetlands one of Africa's largest floodplains, have for millennia regulated the flow of the White Nile. 
      But to British colonial engineers like Sir William Garstin, this vast swamp was simply "inefficient." 
      His 1904 plan to carve a canal through the Sudd aimed to redirect water to Egypt, bypassing what he saw as wasted evaporation.
      The Jonglei Canal, as it came to be known, was a colossal undertaking, stretching over 360 kilometers. 
      However, the project was plagued by technical challenges, political instability, and environmental consequences. 
      The canal's construction disrupted the delicate ecosystem of the Sudd, leading to habitat loss for countless species and altering the region's hydrology. 
      Moreover, the canal failed to deliver the promised water savings, as sedimentation and maintenance issues quickly arose. 
      Today, the Jonglei Canal stands as a stark reminder of how technocratic ambitions can clash with nature's complexity, leaving behind a legacy of ecological damage and unfulfilled promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, as South Sudan faces catastrophic flooding and famine, the unfinished Jonglei Canal stands as a monument to technocratic arrogance. 
      This report argues that the colonial obsession with hydraulic efficiency dismantled natural flood buffers, disrupted nomadic lifeways, and set the stage for modern humanitarian collapse.

    <p>
      By examining original documentssuch as Reports on the Basin of the Upper Nile to medical records in canal zones,
       we can trace a direct line from Garstin's drawing board to the flooded villages of 2025.

  <section id="Key-Questions">
    <h2>Investigative Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How did the colonial focus on "maximum flow" ignore the Sud's role as a flood buffer?</li>
      <li>What were the long-term environmental consequences of the canal's construction?</li>
      <li>How did the canal disrupt traditional nomadic lifestyles and local economies?</li>
      <li>Was water infrastructure a tool to control nomadic populations in the Upper Nile?</li>
      <li>How did Malaria and shistosomiasis rates change after Garstin's interventions?</li>
    </ul>
